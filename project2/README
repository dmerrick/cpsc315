1) How To Compile and Run
Once you extract the tarball, all you need to do is run:

make all

This will build all of the needed binaries. 

2) Requested Input From Professor Yoon

None, thanks for the help!

3) Output to Expect

The program works for the small files, but won't correctly send the medium or large files. Increasing the buffer size removes the runtime errors, but the files still don't send correctly.
