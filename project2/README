1) How To Compile and Run
Once you extract the tarball, all you need to do is run:

make all

This will build all of the needed binaries. 

2) Requested Input From Professor Yoon

Unfortunatly I didnt have time to finish it. Neither sending files nor recieving files works right now, but I made some headway towards the end and I think I could probably fix it.

3) Output to Expect

Incomplete attempts to send and receive data..

4) Anything Else

This was much harder than I expected! :-).
