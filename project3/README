Programming Project 3

1) How To Compile and Run

There is only one source file, so running something like "gcc -o banker banker.c" should work fine.

You provide your configuration file as an arguement. The program does NOT perform sanity checks on your config file, so please use valid input :D.

2) Requested Input From Professor Yoon

Without all of the threads, the code seems to work fine. It will continue to loop (generating random request vectors) until it finally comes to a safe state (or repeats forever? Is that possible?).

I'd be interested to see what I'm doing wrong on the threads, since that's what I've been having the most trouble with.


3) Output to Expect

In it's current state, the program will sit silent for a number of seconds and then spew out various combined outputs from the different threads. If all of the threading code is removed, the program will loop until all of the processes are finished, each time showing the current system state.

Due to a strange issue that I mention in the next session, not every configuration file is parsed correctly. This is only due to this error, and other configuration files can be easily loaded with a minor code alteration.

4) Anything Else

There are a few things to be aware of. The block starting at line 290 that is supposed to update the Need array for each process fails for some reason, it will not increment past 0. It's just a for loop; I have no idea why it's acting like that.
For that reason, the following two lines (296-297) are hardcoded in to work with the input file I used. This prevents flexibility with config files, so keep that in mind.
I would LOVE to know why that's broken.

While the code is my own, I got the idea for the checkCompletion() and allocate() methods from this document -- http://www.scribd.com/doc/7776221/Bankers-algorithm-program -- which I found while looking for other configuration files to use.
