1) How To Compile and Run
Once you extract the tarball, all you need to do is run:

make all

This will build all of the needed binaries.

2) Requested Input From Professor Yoon

N/A

3) Output to Expect

At the moment myls doesn't show the permissions correctly, but I'd like to fix  that with a half hour more time :-).

4) Anything Else

Sorry about last night! I ended up going to sleep. I woke up early this morning so I could get it in before you arrived.
