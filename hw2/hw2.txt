=== Chapter Three ===
3.9) Eight processes are created in total.

3.10) Values of pid (and NOT pid1):
A: 0
B: 0
C: 2600 
D: 2600

3.11) A named pipe would be useful for connecting to a running daemon,
such as a database. Since the pipe will likely be used again, giving it
a name would be beneficial.

Ordinary pipes would be more useful when working with the shell, since
processes tend to be one-off and short lived.

3.13) The output will be "PARENT: value = 5", since the value is modified
in the child process, and that change is not carried over into the
parent process.

3.14a) Synchronous communication allows for lowered overhead at the cost
of increased complexity, while asynchronous communication is inexpensive,
simple, and easier to implement.

3.14b) Automatic buffering makes programming easy, but is more complicated
to implement from the system programmers standpoint. Explicit buffering
offers better control.

3.14c) Send by copy works well in situations where processes do not
share the same main memory. Send by reference allows the data to be
modified locally.

3.14d) Like automatic buffering, variable sized messages are easier on
the programmer but more complicated to implement.
