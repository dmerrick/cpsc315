8.11) First-fit:
(Assuming we start at the beginning each time.)
212KB goes into the 500KB partition. (288KB left)
417KB goes into the 600KB partition. (183KB left)
112KB goes into the 200KB partition. (88KB left)
426KB can't fit anywhere.

Best-fit:
212KB goes into the 300KB partition. (88KB left)
417KB goes into the 500KB partition. (83KB left)
112KB goes into the 200KB partition. (88KB left)
426KB goes into the 600KB partition. (174KB left)

Worst-fit:
212KB goes into the 600KB partition. (388KB left)
417KB goes into the 500KB partition. (83KB left)
112KB goes into the 388KB partition. (276KB left)
426KB can't fit anywhere.

8.18)
page count = 32 = 2^5
words per page = 1024 = 2^10
frame count = 16 = 2^4

a) 16 bits

b) 15 bits

8.20a) There would be two memory lookups, one for the page table and one for the word in memory. This would take 200ms*2=400ms.

b) Via the formula provided: (200ms)*(.75)+(200ms*2)*(1-.75) = 250ms

8.23a) Segment 0 has base 219. Offset 420+219 = 649.

b) Segment 1 has base 2300, offset 10+2300 = 2310.

c) Segment 2 has no table entry, error.

d) Segment 3 has base 1327, offset 400+1327 = 1727.

e) Segment 4 has base 1952, but the offset 112 is greater than the length of the segment, error.

8.27a) The "selector" portion of the logical address is looked at, which points to a descriptor table. The segment descriptor result from the table is combined with the logical address' offset into a 32-bit linear address.

b) By adding this functionality into the Pentium architecture, it removes the need for similar functionality to be built via software. This allows for a simpler operating system and faster memory results.

c) Every logical->physical address conversion requires this table lookup, which could be costly compared to memory implementations free from the descriptor table system.

=== Chapter Nine ===
9.20) 11123456 is a 2^32 byte space, so m=32.
Page size = 4096 = 2^12, so n=12.

page number = m-n = 32-12 = 20 bits

Therefore the last three digits 456 are the page offset, while the remaining 20 bits are the offset on the page table.

9.21)
200 nanoseconds = (100 nanoseconds)*(1-p) + 8ms*(1-0.7)*p + 20ms*(0.7)*p
0.1 = -0.1p + 2400p + 14000p
0.1 ~= 16400p
p ~= 0.0006%

9.28a) A faster CPU will help, but since the CPU is only being used 20% it won't necisaraly have a significant effect. Not a good option.

b) A larger paging disk will not help, since the current disk is 97.7% used in terms of time and not in terms of space.

c) Increasing the degree will not help, since the paging disk is over utilized as it is.

d) Decreasing the degree of multiprogramming will help, because it will relax the strain on the paging disk.

e) Will improve CPU utilization since less pages need to be stored on the disk.

f) Faster disks will surely help, as the time to retreive information off of the (over utilized) disks will be faster.

g) Will improve CPU utilization as the CPU will aquire data much faster.

h) Increasing the page size will help, as it will create more free space for the paging disk to use.

9.31a) Initialize the counters to zero. When a new page is associated with a frame, increase the counters, and decrease the frame when the page is no longer required. The page with the smallest counter should be replaced.

b) Like in class, I drew four boxes on a peice of paper and started filling in values according to the algorithm. I ended up counting thirteen page faults.

c) The optimal algorithm ended up having eleven page faults.
