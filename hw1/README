Programming Project 1

1) How To Compile and Run
Once you extract the tarball, all you need to do is run:

make all

This will build all of the needed binaries. You may need to edit the Makefile to configure the location of your dictionary file.

At that point you can run "make test", which will generate a number of .out files, one for each task. If you need to rebuild a certain binary for whatever reason, just specify it by name, i.e. "make palin2d256".

2) Requested Input From Professor Yoon

Although I have much experience READING C/C++, I have very little experience writing it. Using best practices is important to me, and I'm sure there is a lot of room for improvement here. Please let me know anything that you think I could benefit from.

3) Output to Expect

Besides the output from the various make tasks, you the output of these programs should be very similar to that of grep.

4) Anything Else

"make time" will time each execution, as requested in question 2d. The tests are run in order from fastest to slowest, with the first (non 5 char limit) program being executed last.

There are a number of make tasks you can use, such as clean, and package.

I used git for SCM during this project. The git repo can be found here:
